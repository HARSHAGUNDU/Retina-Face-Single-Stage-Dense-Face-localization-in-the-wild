# Retina-Face-Single-Stage-Dense-Face-localization-in-the-wild

This paper presents a robust single-stage face detector, named RetinaFace, which performs pixel-wise face localisation on various scales of faces by taking advantages of joint extra-supervised and self-supervised multi-task learning.

Dataset:
The training dataset used in this project is captured from phone. We propose a custom dataset annotated manually by us. The dataset is annotated for facial landmarks eye centers, nose tip and mouth corners. We use 
https://github.com/Mukosame/Face-Annotation-Tool for data annotation.

Annotating Images:
For data annotation we used the tool, https://github.com/Mukosame/FaceAnnotation-Tool git clone https://github.com/Mukosame/Face-Annotation-Tool.git
